Description: A guidance system for analysis with missing data. It incorporates 
  expert, up-to-date methodology to help researchers choose the most 
  appropriate analysis approach when some data are missing. You provide the 
  available data and the assumed causal structure, including the likely causes 
  of missing data. 'midoc' will advise whether multiple imputation is needed, and 
  if so, how best to perform it.
