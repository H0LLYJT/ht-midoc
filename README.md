The Multiple Imputation DOCtor (`midoc`) R package is a decision-making
system which incorporates expert, up-to-date guidance to help you choose
the most appropriate analysis method when there are missing data.
`midoc` will guide you through your analysis, examining the structure of
the dataset to advise on whether multiple imputation (MI) is needed, and
if so how to perform it.

## Installation

You can install the development version of midoc from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
